<!-- Why TO Choose Iran Air -->
<div id="info">
<h1>Why To Choose Iran Air?</h1>
<div class="temp">
	<h3>The Preferred Airline:</h3>
	<p>On March 5, 1340, the two companies Iranian Airways and Parshin Airservice were merged into the Union and Iran National Company (Homa), with the international name of Iran Air (IRAN AIR). This company was declared national and took over all the facilities and personnel of the two companies and started its activities from April 1341.</p>
</div>
<div class="temp">
	<h3>Great Place to Work:</h3>
	<p>The first flight of Homa with jet aircraft was carried out in 1344 using a Boeing 727-100 on the Tehran-Beirut route. The company then decided to convert its entire fleet to jet aircraft. With the beginning of the 1350s, the golden age of Homa also began. In 1350, a number of Boeing 737-100 and in 1353 a number of Boeing 727-200 entered the company's fleet. Also, the delivery of expensive Boeing 747 airplanes of 100, 200 and SP types started in 1354.</p>
</div>
<div class="temp">
	<h3>Safety First:</h3>
    <p>In the late 1970s, National Iranian Airlines was known as the fastest growing airline in the world, and at the same time, it was considered one of the safest, most modern, and most profitable airlines in the world. In 1355, after the Australian company Qantas, Homa was named the safest airline in the world; Before the Islamic revolution, there were 3 incidents of Homa related to the crash of three Douglas DC-3 planes of this company in the years 1329 to 1331. turn it into a cargo and passenger transit center in the world.</p>
</div>
<div class="temp">
	<h3>Performance Guarantee:</h3>
	<p>The official name of the company was changed to Islamic Republic of Iran Airlines in 1981. This year, Homa transported 1.7 million passengers.

        At the beginning of the 1990s, despite the strong increase in demand for air travel, due to the sanctions imposed on Iran's aviation industry by the United States, Homa was only able to purchase a few Fokker 100 small aircraft from its Dutch manufacturer.</p>
